    <p align = "left">The song itself appears to be about Shiloh's feelings for someone and their feelings towards her, or lack thereof, hence the eponymous title. <br>
        The sentiment that being in love with this person is a bad idea is echoed throughout the entirety of the song, <br>
         which really allows the fact that unreciprocated love is a bad idea to be interpreted.</p>

        In other words, this lady takes good care of herself so effortlessly and is possibly in a managerial position of some sort. She's got her whole life sorted and this is the exact kind of woman he needs. <br>
